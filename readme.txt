mGitHub.SampleApp is a Windown Phone 7 sample application written using Caliburn.Micro. 

Application is offering acces to projects and repositories on GitHub. 
You can navigate trough few preselected repositories and users/projects, 
see detais, view project contributors and few other features.

It started as a pet-project to try out development for WP7 using Caliburn.Micro.
All went so well so that now I am doing everything possible to offer a greater 
and better experience of working with GitHub on a Windows Phone 7 device. 				
I hope that very soon a new application will be available in 
Windows Phone Marketplace with an essentially improved experience and more features.

This application will be published on GitHub so everyone interested in WP7 development will 
have one more sample project to look at beginning of their exploration of a new and interesting platform.

Any feedback, bug reports and suggestions are highly welcome.

The project is licenced under MIT licence.
